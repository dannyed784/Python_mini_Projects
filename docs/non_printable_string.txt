import string
print(string.printable)

#This returns a string containing all the characters 
#that are generally considered safe and printable:

0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~\r\x0b\x0c

code example:
raw_list = ['P', 'W', 'd', 'o', '8', '2', 'm', '\x8f']

cleaned_list = [ch for ch in raw_list if ch in string.printable]
print(cleaned_list)

what this line does?
#it loops through raw_list
#keeps only characters that are found in string.printable
#Removes anything "weird" or unreadable

['P', 'W', 'd', 'o', '8', '2', 'm']  # '\x8f' is gone!


[ch for ch in raw_list if ch in string.printable]

ch : Each item/character from the original list (raw_list)
for ch in raw_list: Loops through each element in raw_list
if ch in string.printable: Keeps only the elements that are 
in string.printable (i.e., clean ones)
